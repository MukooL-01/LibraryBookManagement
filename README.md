ðŸ“š LibraryBookManagement
is a simple Java-based console application designed to simulate a basic library system.
It allows students to register, log in using their admission numbers, view available books, and issue books from the library.
The project uses concepts like Interfaces, Abstract Classes, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles, and arrays for storing student and book data.

âœ¨ Features:
Initialize and manage available books

Student registration and login system

View list of available books with copies

Issue books with admission number and issue date

Tracks total, issued, and remaining books

Clean and modular code structure

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
Java

OOP Concepts (Interface, Abstraction, Inheritance)

ðŸ“‹ Future Improvements (optional ideas):
Add a "Return Book" feature

Use ArrayList instead of static arrays for scalability

Implement book search and student book history

Add file handling to save issued book records
